# New Nav On Click

### Todos:

- [x] Highlight the X (close) button on search bar focus
- [x] When you close the search bar, clear out input so the search terms disappear
- [x] When page loads, clear the search bar input so it doesn't show the search terms when you click back in browser
- [x] When search bar is active and focused, the next tab should be the search terms
- [ ] When typing in the search bar, you should be able to click arrows to highlight a search term
- [ ] Add functionality on ENTER or Submit to look for search term match or submit search to google site search (I'll provide assistance on this)
  - [ ] This is how the search submit function should go: Search submit is triggered -- enter hit or submit clicked... { Does search input value equal one of the search terms? if so, redirect to the location that matches that term if not, redirect to "https://www.friscoisd.org/search-results?cx=017951229044668060468%3Anrd98uepiu8&cof=FORID%3A11&q=" + search input value }
